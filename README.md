## ü™≤ Current Bugs/TODO list

- For some reason created a new column when province (and maybe others) was edited for cableway BC
- For some reason cannot edit the province for weir (and maybe others)
- A section without a field cannot be edited
- Edits are being made to ONE page of the excel (so only one location/province) but not all of them

- Turn into an actual desktop application where the site xlsx documents are saved to a network/sharepoint
- Will more than one person be able to have the app open at once?
