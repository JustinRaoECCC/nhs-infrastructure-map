## ü™≤ Current Bugs/TODO list

- For some reason created a new column when province (and maybe others) was edited for cableway BC
- For some reason cannot edit the province for weir (and maybe others)
- A section without a field cannot be edited

- Turn into an actual desktop application where the site xlsx documents are saved to a network/sharepoint
- Will more than one person be able to have the app open at once?


June 16th, 2025 full system test



Overall system
- Randomly doesn't let me type, and the only fix is to rerun the app or wait some time
    - for some reason this is fixed by clicking off screen and clicking back on screen

TODO
- From the excel insert button, any provinces that are identified should be auto added to the lookup file just like how the assettypes and categories do



TODO (need to ask Khodi)
- When a station is made inactive, should it grey out and fully switch Asset Type to INACTIVE
    - Also then the data should be copied to the INACTIVE excel
    - This would mean we need to implement: "If INACTIVE becomes ACTIVE it would been to play it in a different excel for the specific AssetType
